Filipino Buchi Recipe

The History of Buchi:
Buchi, a popular Filipino delicacy, is a delightful treat made from glutinous rice flour and sweet bean paste, typically coated in sesame seeds and deep-fried to crispy perfection. This dessert has its roots in Chinese cuisine, where it's known as "jianshui zong" or "sesame balls." The Filipino version, buchi, has evolved to incorporate local flavors and has become a beloved snack enjoyed across the Philippines. Here's how to make this delicious treat at home:

Ingredients:
1 cup glutinous rice flour
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup sweet red bean paste or mung bean paste
Sesame seeds (white or black), for coating
Oil for frying

Instructions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour and water. Knead until it forms a smooth, pliable dough. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water; if it's too sticky, add a bit more flour. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.

Divide the dough into small portions, rolling each into a ball about 1 inch in diameter. Flatten each ball with your palms, forming a small disc.

Place a small amount (about a teaspoon) of sweet red bean paste or mung bean paste in the center of each disc. Carefully seal the edges, shaping it back into a ball.

Roll each filled ball in sesame seeds, ensuring they coat the surface evenly.

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully drop in the prepared buchi balls. Fry them in batches, turning occasionally, until they turn golden brown and crispy. This should take about 3-4 minutes per batch.

Remove the buchi from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.

Serve the buchi while they're still warm and crispy. Enjoy your delicious Filipino buchi!
