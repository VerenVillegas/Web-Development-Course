Banana Cake Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
4 ripe bananas, mashed
½ cup plain yogurt or sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch cake pan or two 9-inch round cake pans.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the mashed bananas, yogurt (or sour cream), and vanilla extract until well combined.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan(s) and spread it evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes for round pans or 30-35 minutes for a rectangular pan, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.
Once cooled, you can optionally frost the cake with cream cheese frosting or a simple powdered sugar glaze.

Enjoy your homemade banana cake!
