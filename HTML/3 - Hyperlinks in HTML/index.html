        <h2 id="h2-1">What is a cat?</h2>
        <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, 
            is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology 
            and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. 
            It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. 
            It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. 
            It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 
            It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. 
            Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. 
            It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.

        <h2 id="h2-2">The biggest cat</h2>
        <p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the biggest species of cat. 
            These iconic, striped felines also grow up to 10 feet (3 m) long like lions, but tigers are heavier and can weigh up to 660 pounds (300 kg), according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). 
            That's three times heavier than the heaviest puma.

        <h2 id="h2-3">The smallest cat</h2>
        <p>
            The rusty-spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus) is one of the cat family's smallest members, of which historical records are known only from India and Sri Lanka.
            [3] In 2012, it was also recorded in the western Terai of Nepal.[4] Since 2016, the global wild population is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List as it is fragmented and affected by loss and destruction of its prime habitat, deciduous forests.
