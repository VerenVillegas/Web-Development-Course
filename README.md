# Welcome to my web development course!
This is a repository I created to host all of my code examples as well as supplementary resources to my web development course on YouTube. 

## How to use
1. Select the folder corresponding to the topic that you want to cover (E.G. Browse the "HTML" folder if you want to go to a resource about HTML)
2. Select the number of the folder that corresponds to the video number (E.G. Go the the "1." folder in the HTML folder if you want the first resource surrounding HTML. This will be the resource for the first HTML video covered in the course, etc etc.)
3. Download the resource for you to use.

Thank you again for visting my repository!
